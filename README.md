TITLE: Loops in C++

AIM: To write programs in c++ using loops and statements. 

THEORY:   Loops in C++ are control structures that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are three main types of loops:

1. **For Loop**: It iterates a specific number of times, defined by an initialization, condition, and update statement.

2. **While Loop**: It repeats as long as a specified condition is true, and the condition is checked before each iteration.

3. **Do-While Loop**: Similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.

Loops are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks and are a crucial part of any programming language, including C++.

ALGORITHM:
1. Start
2.Declare an integer variable a.
3.Display "Enter the value a:" to prompt the user for input.
4.Read the input value and store it in the variable a.
5.Check if a is divisible by 2 (i.e., if a % 2 == 0):
6.If true, go to the next step.
7.If false, go to step 9.
8.Within the true branch, check if a is equal to 0:
9.If true, display "Zero."
10.If false, go to the next step.
11.Display "Even number" (as a is even and not zero).
12.End the if-else structure.
13.If a is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it's an odd number):
14.Display "Odd number."
15. End the program.

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, loops in C++ are essential control structures that enable repetitive execution of a code block. 
They help automate tasks by iterating through a range of values or executing code as long as a specified condition remains true.
C++ offers three primary types of loops: for, while, and do-while, each with unique use cases. Loops are fundamental for efficient, concise, and flexible program design.
